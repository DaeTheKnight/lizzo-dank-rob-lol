Dank, a 300-pound party queen with glitter in her beard and a cape made of pizza boxes, decided it was finally time to fulfill her dream of crowd surfing — unfortunately, the "crowd" was just one unlucky guy: Rob. As the DJ screamed, “Get ready to elevate your souls!” Dank bellowed, “ROOOOB, I BELIEVE IN YOU!” and hurled herself from the stage like a majestic, airborne burrito. Rob, clutching his precious *Bagha Blue* book like it was the last Horcrux, shrieked and bolted, zigzagging through the dance floor like a squirrel on Red Bull. Behind him, Dank briefly caught air — and then physics caught up, demanding a sacrifice.
